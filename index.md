# markdown on github
###### although this is my first time using markdown on github, it seems easy enough. 
###### Right now I'm adjusting the size of the text. the size depends on how many octothropes I use when commenting. 
###### the biggest size will have the least amount of octothrope. 
###### and the smallest size is 6 octothrope. This means that there is a limit of 6 sizes of text on github's markdown
